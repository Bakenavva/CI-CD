## Description
As a student of Full Stack Web Development, I want to learn how the Continuous Integration/ Continuous Delivery, or Deployment, (CI/CD) process works. I have been provided starter code that contains a functioning full stack quiz project alongside cypress tests. I have implemented a dev.yml which runs testing on components through use of GitHub Actions, when a branch is PR'd into develop & a main.yml which triggers an auto deploy, upon a merge into main. 

Attached is a snippet of the Quiz portion from the Deployed Application on Render:
